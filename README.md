The FilamentPHP Exposure Picker is an intuitive and efficient tool designed to enhance user experience by allowing easy selection of the sun's exposure direction through a simple dropdown. Users can input cardinal and intercardinal directions such as N (North), NE (Northeast), E (East), SE (Southeast), S (South), SW (Southwest), W (West), and NW (Northwest) to accurately specify the direction of sunlight exposure. This feature is particularly useful for applications related to real estate, gardening, or any other domain where sunlight direction plays a critical role. The picker simplifies data entry, ensuring that users can quickly and effortlessly input precise information.
